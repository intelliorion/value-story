# Delivery pathways — CSIC

Consulted when recommending a pathway. Work by DISQUALIFICATION, not preference.

## Citizen-Led — business builds and owns, TTIA advises

Business teams independently build and manage **low-complexity** solutions using
**approved** citizen-development tools, with technology visibility and
governance oversight. **The business owns the solution end-to-end.**

Tools: **Copilot · Copilot Studio · Power Apps · AI@MS agents**

What it demands: that it is genuinely low-complexity, on an approved tool, and
that the business has accepted **support**, not just build. There is no squad
behind you. When it breaks in eighteen months, it is still yours.

## TTIA-Led — TTIA builds, Corporate Services owns

TTIA designs, builds and delivers solutions that **Corporate Services chooses to
own and support throughout their lifecycle**. It creates delivery capacity
outside the traditional Technology Book of Work while keeping required
governance and controls.

Tools: everything Citizen-Led has, **plus Dataiku · UiPath · Snowflake Cortex ·
a vibe-coded custom app.** This is the path that takes a citizen-built idea to
the next level.

What it demands: **CS must choose to own and support it.** TTIA builds it and
hands it over. If nobody in CS has agreed to hold it afterwards, this is the
orphan waiting to happen — and it is the single most common reason an item is
carried over.

## Partnered Development — Technology owns the asset, you own the outcome

Corporate Services and Technology jointly deliver. Partner Developers add
capacity inside a Technology squad. **Technology retains lifecycle ownership.**

This is the one people misunderstand. "Partnered" sounds like help. Here is what
it actually means:

| area | Technology | CS / Partner Developer |
|---|---|---|
| Ownership | owns the asset and lifecycle | owns the **business outcome** |
| Development | leads engineering governance | adds delivery capacity |
| Architecture | accountable | contributes within agreed scope |
| Testing & code review | accountable | may participate, **cannot self-approve** |
| Deployment | Technology only | **no production deployment** |
| Production support | Technology accountable | limited to agreed support and knowledge transfer |
| Squad direction | Technology squad leads the work | Partner Developer works within the squad |
| People management | n/a | remains with the CS manager |

Say it plainly: **Partnered gives you engineering capacity, not control.** If
what you want is to keep control, you want TTIA-Led — and that means CS accepts
support forever.

What it demands: **a named Technology team must accept lifecycle ownership.**
Not "was mentioned in a meeting". Accepted.

## Pro-Dev (Technology-Led) — Technology builds, owns and operates

Technology-led delivery for enterprise-scale, strategically prioritised
solutions requiring dedicated engineering teams, full SDLC governance and
long-term Technology ownership and support.

What it demands: that it is genuinely enterprise-scale and strategically
prioritised enough to earn a dedicated team. Most things are not, and saying so
early is a kindness.

## Choosing the pathway — the disqualifier test

**Do not start from what they want. Start from what rules each path out.** People
choose a pathway by how fast it looks; the path is actually decided by
integration, scale, risk and who will maintain it.

Ask these in order and stop at the first path that is not disqualified.

### 1. Can it be Citizen-Led?

All three must be true. One "no" disqualifies it.

- **Does the requesting team have a person who can actually build this** in
  Copilot Studio, Copilot, or configure agents in AI@MS? Not "we could learn" —
  a named person who has done it.
- **Will that team maintain it?** The client side is accountable for
  maintenance. TTIA advises; it does not hold the pager.
- **Does it stay inside Microsoft?** Citizen-Led cannot take complex
  integrations — no database connections, no API sources outside Microsoft
  products.

> "You need one connection to a system that is not Microsoft. That rules out
> Citizen-Led on its own, whatever else is true."

The maintenance question is the one people skip and regret. Ask it directly:
*"In eighteen months, when the person who built this has moved teams and it
breaks — who fixes it?"* If there is no answer, this is not Citizen-Led however
simple the build looks.

### 2. Can it be TTIA-Led?

This is where **CSLab**, the TTIA sandbox team, engages. It handles what
Citizen-Led cannot:

- integration with existing data sources — **LDAP, Manhattan, Security**, and
  the like
- additional coding: data flows, workflows, format conversion
- the wider toolset: Dataiku, UiPath, Snowflake Cortex, a vibe-coded custom app

**But it has a ceiling, and the ceiling is firm.** TTIA-Led requires
**below-medium scale**:

- fewer users
- lower risk level
- **no PII**

Any one of those broken and it is not TTIA-Led, regardless of how keen anyone is.

> "The integration is fine for CSLab. The PII is not. That takes this to
> Partnered whatever the volume looks like."

Remember the handover: **TTIA builds, Corporate Services owns and supports.** A
TTIA-Led item still needs a named CS owner who has accepted it for life.

### 3. Partnered or Pro-Dev

Everything above the TTIA-Led ceiling:

- complex integration
- live ingestion
- large data volumes
- high risk
- **PII**

Between the two: **Partnered** adds CS delivery capacity inside a Technology
squad, with Technology owning the asset. **Pro-Dev** is Technology-led for
enterprise-scale, strategically prioritised work with a dedicated team and full
SDLC. Most things are not Pro-Dev, and saying so early is a kindness.

## The four disqualifiers, in one line each

Say these plainly when they apply — they save more time than anything else in
the session:

| if this is true | it cannot be |
|---|---|
| no skilled builder in the requesting team, or nobody will maintain it | Citizen-Led |
| any integration outside Microsoft products | Citizen-Led |
| PII, high risk, many users, or large volume | TTIA-Led |
| live ingestion or complex integration | Citizen-Led or TTIA-Led |
| a large audience on a per-seat tool, with a benefit smaller than the licence | that tool, on any pathway |

### Failure pattern: path shopping

Choosing the fastest-looking path rather than the one the constraints allow.
Almost always shows up as Citizen-Led chosen for something with a real
integration, or TTIA-Led chosen for something carrying PII. Test the claim
against the four disqualifiers rather than accepting the preference — and say
what you are doing, so it reads as saving them a rejection rather than blocking
them.

## The licence maths — ask audience size early

**Complexity is not the only thing that rules a tool out. Cost per seat does
too, and it works in the opposite direction.** Scale normally pushes an item UP
the ladder — more users, more risk, more governance. Per-seat licensing can push
it AWAY from a tool even when the complexity would be fine.

So ask this in the first few minutes, not at the end:

> **"How many people end up touching this — and are they using it, or just
> reading the output?"**

### Do the arithmetic out loud

`licence per seat × audience × 12 = annual run cost`

A Dataiku reader licence is about **$10 per person per month**. For a dozen
people that is a rounding error. For four hundred it is roughly $48,000 a year,
every year, for something whose benefit nobody has sized yet.

> "Four hundred users on a reader licence is about forty-eight thousand a year.
> That is not a reason to stop — it is a reason to know what the benefit is
> before you commit to it. What does the current process cost?"

**This is why the cost question forces the benefit question.** You cannot judge
a per-seat tool without a sized benefit, and a function that cannot size the
benefit has just discovered why the measure matters.

Copilot is per-seat too. Citizen-Led is not free — it is *already paid for* if
the team has the licences, and a new cost if they do not. Ask which.

### The pattern that usually saves it: authors vs readers

Most initiatives have **a few people who build and many who consume**. If the
consumers only need the output, they may not need the tool at all.

> "Five people build in Dataiku, five licences. The other four hundred read a
> published output in somewhere they already have — SharePoint, a dashboard, an
> email. The cost question disappears."

Ask it directly: **"Does the audience need the tool, or the answer?"** If they
need the answer, architect for that and the licence maths stops deciding the
pathway.

### When cost genuinely disqualifies

| situation | consequence |
|---|---|
| large audience, per-seat tool, unsized benefit | **not ready** — size the benefit first |
| large audience, per-seat tool, benefit smaller than the annual licence | the tool is wrong, not the idea |
| large audience who only need the output | re-architect: few authors, published output |
| licence cost has no owning cost centre | a carry-over risk — someone has to pay it every year |

### Where it lands on the form

The annual run cost belongs in **BUSINESS BENEFITS** as a net position, not a
hidden footnote. A benefit of "capacity released" alongside a $48k licence is a
different case from the same benefit for free, and CSIC will find out either
way. Better it comes from the submitter.

It also belongs in the sustainability answer: **whose cost centre carries it,
every year.** A licence with no owner is how an initiative quietly dies at the
next budget round.

## How long each pathway takes

Duration changes the answer. A function that would accept Partnered for a
strategic item will not accept it for something they needed last month, and
knowing that early stops a lot of wasted preparation.

<!-- TTIA: fill these in. Do not let the skill invent them. -->

| pathway | typical time to live | what drives the variation |
|---|---|---|
| Citizen-Led | _TBC_ | builder availability; approval of the tool |
| TTIA-Led (CSLab) | _TBC_ | CSLab capacity; number of data sources |
| Partnered | _TBC_ | Technology squad availability; SDLC gates |
| Pro-Dev | _TBC_ | prioritisation cycle; dedicated team formation |

**Until these are filled in, do not state a duration.** Say what actually drives
it instead — "this waits on CSLab capacity" or "this waits on a Technology squad
accepting it" — which is more useful than a number anyway, and true.

If someone needs it by a date, work backwards out loud: *"Partnered means a
squad has to accept it, then SDLC gates. If you need this in six weeks, the
honest options are a Citizen-Led version that does less, or moving the date."*
