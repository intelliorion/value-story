# Mode B — the value report

**POST-SUBMISSION.** Companion to `SKILL.md`, which covers everything up to the
form. Load this only when an initiative is **in service** and there is an
outcome to report. Mode A predicted a benefit and named who
would capture the baseline; this is where that promise is tested.

## Step 1 — find the intake record, and hold it to account

If an intake record exists, read it first and answer three questions in the
report itself:

- **Was the baseline actually captured?** The record named an owner and a date.
  Did it happen? If not, the outcome cannot be evidenced, and the report says
  so rather than working around it.
- **Is the benefit the one predicted?** Initiatives routinely deliver something
  other than the case that was approved. That is not a failure. Reporting the
  approved benefit when a different one arrived is.
- **Is the accountable person still accountable?** If they moved, name who
  holds it now, or say nobody does.

No intake record? Say so at the top. It means nobody agreed in advance what
success would look like, and everything below is being defined after the fact.

## Step 2 — read the sources and list what you read

Status reports, system exports, the portfolio record, email threads. **If you
did not open it, you may not cite it.** List every document by name.

## Step 3 — the claim table, before any prose

| id | tier | metric | before | after | unit | value driver | source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| tier | when | requires |
|---|---|---|
| **measured** | a real before and after exist in a cited source | both figures, a unit, and the document they came from |
| **estimated** | inferred or asserted, not measured | the assumption stated, and a person or role who owns it |
| **qualitative** | something changed with no number | a sentence, and **no figure at all** |

**The test: could someone re-run the query and get the same number?** If yes,
measured. If no, estimated.

**A rubric score is never a business result.** Effectiveness 4, efficiency 2, a
priority score that moved between assessments — prioritisation judgements about
what to build next. A grade that moved is a reassessment that used more
evidence, not a change in the world. This is the most tempting fake outcome
available; refuse it.

## Step 4 — write the report on the five cards

1. **What problem were we solving?** — prose, no figures
2. **What capability did AI unlock?** — prose, no figures
3. **What outcome improved?** — carries the claims from the table
4. **Which value driver did it advance?** — one primary
5. **Who is accountable?** — named leader, value realization owner, reporting
   cadence, and whether the number is actually tracked today

**Cards 1, 2, 4 and 5 contain no figures.** A number in prose is a number
nobody can trace.

## Step 5 — the five leadership questions, including the ones you cannot answer

1. How much more productivity did we get?
2. How much risk did we reduce? — control exceptions, error rates, audit findings
3. What new capabilities do we now have?
4. How much cost did we avoid? — cost avoided, never revenue
5. How many employees and functions were enabled?

**Risk and reach are the two that get missed.** "No baseline was captured, so
processing time is not claimed" is more useful than a number nobody can defend,
and it points at the fix.

## Step 6 — the artifact

Rebuild `case.html` in the past tense as `value-report.html`, so the two can be
read side by side: what was expected, and what happened. Same structure, same
tier discipline — but now `measured` is available, and an expected benefit that
did not arrive is reported rather than quietly replaced.

One self-contained HTML file. No CDN, no external font, no script: it must open
offline and print without losing meaning. Render the tier **structurally, not as
a label** — measured shows a before and after, estimated shows the figure with
its assumption and owner beside it, qualitative shows a sentence and no figure.

## Before it goes to anyone

- [ ] Every figure traces to a claim in the table.
- [ ] No figure in a headline or in prose.
- [ ] No qualitative claim contains a numeral.
- [ ] Every measured claim has a before, an after, a unit and a named source.
- [ ] Every estimated claim names who owns the assumption.
- [ ] No rubric score is tiered measured.
- [ ] Every cited document was actually opened.
- [ ] Each of the five questions answered, or reported as unanswered.
- [ ] The intake record's baseline promise reported on — kept or not.

## Not repairs

- Downgrading a measured claim to qualitative because the baseline cannot be
  found. Find the number, or state the gap.
- Deleting a claim so a value driver looks better covered.
- Rewording a number to make a problem go away.
- Citing a document nobody read.

Close by saying whether the initiative can evidence what it claims. If it
cannot, the finding is not that the initiative failed — it is that nobody
captured the before. Name who should start now.
